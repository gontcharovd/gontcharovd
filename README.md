### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data engineer who helps the aluminum rolling and recycling leader [Novelis](https://www.novelis.com/) with bridging the technological gap between its legacy data systems and the modern cloud. I have a technical understanding of the data and the aluminum industry through my experience as a process engineer and my metallurgical engineering education.

I write a weekly newsletter about the challenges and opportunities of data, analytics and AI in the aluminum industry. You can subscribe and learn more about me and my work on my [website](https://gontcharov.be).
